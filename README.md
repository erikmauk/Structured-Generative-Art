Computational Art: Lab 5 (Randomly Generated Skyline)

In this lab, I created a function for one building and had a for loop make multiple buildings.

The skyline is made from buildings that are created using a rectangle and the windows are iterated using a for loop.
The buildings are randomized in their width and height to an extent and in their color.
Every time this is run, a different skyline appears. 
Another cool easter egg is that the stars in the night sky are from the last lab!


Within this repository, you will find a demo video of the final product attached. Enjoy!
